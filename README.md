# Overview
This project involves building a simple ray tracer by following the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book. Realistically, I'm following and writing along with the code in the book, but I'm also trying to see how things work by making changes to the code. The objective of this project is to complete the exercises in the book but also understand more about graphics programming.

# Usage
Currently, this is being developed on Ubuntu Linux. As such, I'm not sure how well it works on
other OSes, specifically Windows. However, my intention is to get it working on Windows too.

# Objectives
The objectives are really just the chapter headings:
- [X] Output an image
- [ ] The vec3 class
- [ ] Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
- [ ] Adding a Sphere
- [ ] Surface Normals and Multiple Objects
- [ ] Moving Camera Code Into It's On Class
- [ ] Antialiasing
- [ ] Diffuse Materials
- [ ] Metal
- [ ] Dielectrics
- [ ] Positionable Camera
- [ ] Defocus Blur

# Useful Resources
The following resources have helped me in one way or the other, so far:

Cmake:

- [YouTube video that helped me to get a basic understanding of CMake and how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlKcXPUJGwA). There's also a markdown document in the repo that has something specificallly for using CMake in this project so these 2 can be used in conjunction.

Ray Tracing:
- [YouTube video that codes along with the activities in the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHNewYRvgSk). I haven't completed it yet, since I haven't completed the book either, but it's helped me to understand some things so far.
